## Collaboration Record

#### Hanah Leventhal – hal38:
#### Contribution:
Non-technical contributions involve organizing and rallying the group. I assigned everyone tasks, set up all work sessions, and kept tabs on our to-do items to make sure they were getting done. When communication was low, I prompted responses from our group members to ensure we were all on the same page. Finally, I made sure everyone was aware of the Tuesday testing slot and assignment due date/time.

On the technical side of things, I focussed mainly on the CSS and JS of the overall application (minus the individual games). I revamped the CSS for all pages in order for it to look more like the Figma design, and added important instructional text. I then reworked the JS redirect functions to use hover with delayed mouse input, and eventually Kinect data. I finished writing and calibrating the Kinect data parsing functions, as well as the functions meant to use the connect data to detect button selection (overlap of coordinates). I was also responsible for creating and debugging the cursor functions. Finally, I created the google survey and updated the results pages with a QR code to allow for score submissions for our scoreboards.
