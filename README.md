Collaboration Record
The purpose of the record is to document what each member of the team worked on for each deliverable, as in this template. The absence of this record in Gradescope will result in a deduction of 33% of the assignment grade.

Contribution:
Non-technical contributions involve organizing and rallying the group. I assigned everyone tasks, set up all work sessions, and kept tabs on our to-do items to make sure they were getting done. When communication was low, I prompted responses from our group members to ensure we were all on the same page. Finally, I made sure everyone was aware of the Tuesday testing slot and assignment due date/time.
On the technical side of things, I focussed mainly on the CSS and JS of the overall application (minus the individual games). I revamped the CSS for all pages in order for it to look more like the Figma design, and added important instructional text. I then reworked the JS redirect functions to use hover with delayed mouse input, and eventually Kinect data. I finished writing and calibrating the Kinect data parsing functions, as well as the functions meant to use the connect data to detect button selection (overlap of coordinates). I was also responsible for creating and debugging the cursor functions. Finally, I created the google survey and updated the results pages with a QR code to allow for score submissions for our scoreboards.

Contribution: 
Created the raft rush game. The game is an interacting raft game where you use buttons to move your boat left or right to avoid obstacles. Edited all of the html files to add data flow across the pages and fixed issues with the cursor as well.

Jacob Feit Mann – jjf77:
Contribution: 
Researched libraries and strategies for us to employ in the making of the prototype. I helped with my groupmates’ questions. I spent the vast majority of my time (roughly 17 hours) on implementing an asteroid-destroying game, which quite unfortunately was left on the cutting room floor.
